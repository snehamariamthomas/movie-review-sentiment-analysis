# Summary
This project focused on employing advanced sentiment analysis techniques to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, utilizing user-generated content from platforms such as IMDb. The primary objective was to enhance understanding of audience reception and improve decision-making processes for filmmakers, marketers, and streaming services.

Initially, a Naive Bayes classifier using unigrams was implemented, achieving an accuracy of 79.5% and establishing a baseline for sentiment classification. Subsequently, the analysis progressed to more sophisticated methods, including bigrams and trigrams, and incorporated lasso and ridge regression for regularization. The ridge regression model with trigrams demonstrated superior performance, attaining an accuracy of 80.5%, precision of 77.20%, and recall of 85.12%. This modelâ€™s enhanced performance underscores its effectiveness in capturing nuanced sentiment and reducing misclassifications.

These results are significant for practical applications such as predicting box office performance, refining recommendation systems, and tailoring marketing strategies. The improved accuracy and contextual understanding of the ridge regression model offer valuable insights for enhancing sentiment analysis.
